There is a girl named Java went to a CS400 party. There are two young men whose name is Vim and Emacs. They are good friends and they all admire Java for her beauty and kindness. Now, Java is sitting on the bar table. Both Vim and Emacs want to give it a try. They go over to Java and start cracking jokes to her. Her response, "System.out.println("LOL"). It turned into a competition for the two of them and from there forward they each tried to make Java laugh the hardest.
